IEEE Spectrum has recently published an [opinion piece](https://spectrum.ieee.org/stories-of-the-war-in-ukraine-roman) on the Russia-Ukraine war, sharing perspectives from the Russian IEEE member, Roman L. Gorbunov. The official reason for publishing the piece is “to promote discussion and for the insights they reveal about the plurality of views among IEEE members”. While it is generally appropriate to promote discussion and share different views in a research magazine, there are several issues with publishing the aforementioned opinion piece, which we detail below. Specifically, IEEE Spectrum knowingly published misinformation and Russian propaganda. 

We, the undersigned request that:
* IEEE Spectrum acknowledges that they have unwittingly published a piece furthering misinformation and Russian propaganda.
* IEEE Spectrum revises the piece by adding critical missing context throughout the piece (see details below).
* IEEE Spectrum initiates a broader conversation on misinformation/disinformation and propaganda; if the editors wish to really make a difference, they should immediately announce a special issue on the topic of how to detect and mitigate misinformation and fake media.

We include the full text of the letter and all the signatories below.

## Asks

This section reflects the opinion of the authors. Here we discuss the specific constructive suggestions on how the IEEE Spectrum could make a difference and mitigate the impact from the present situation. First, we ask for a special issue on combating disinformation, with an editorial therein acknowledging that IEEE Spectrum should have caught this issue earlier. Second, we expect some immediate dissemination via email to the entire IEEE Spectrum readership with a statement of IEEE Spectrum concern for the situation. It would also be useful to include e.g. links to places where readers can donate funds to help refugees, and information on how readers can get their institutions to offer visiting positions to qualified academic refugees. We are open to engage with IEEE Spectrum in a further dialogue.

## Letter

IEEE Spectrum has recently initiated [“Stories of the War in Ukraine”](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/collections/ukraine-stories/), a collection of stories aimed at covering the Russia-Ukraine war and personal experiences of the affected IEEE members. As an example, two first-hand accounts by Ukrainian engineers ([Hanna Porieva](https://spectrum.ieee.org/stories-of-the-war-in-ukraine-hanna) and [Volodymyr Pyliavskyi](https://spectrum.ieee.org/stories-of-the-war-in-ukraine-volodymyr)) have been published. We thank IEEE Spectrum for sharing these stories.

At the same time, IEEE Spectrum has also published an [opinion piece](https://spectrum.ieee.org/stories-of-the-war-in-ukraine-roman) sharing perspectives from the Russian IEEE member, Roman L. Gorbunov. This was done “to promote discussion and for the insights they reveal about the plurality of views among IEEE members”. We argue that this piece is instead only furthering misinformation and Russian propaganda. Here are the issues we found with this publication.

The interviewee admits “I don’t feel I’m informed about the situation in Ukraine.” He repeatedly says that “no one knows what is really happening”, “the whole picture isn’t clear”, etc. Here, the editors failed to provide any context regarding abundance of credible information about the war. Instead they even chose to highlight the quote “I believe that no one knows what is really happening. We see some facts, which look quite realistic, followed by numerous very questionable interpretations.” by the interviewee which suggests some ambiguity of interpreting the events in Ukraine. This begs the question if there was a failure of editorial integrity by publishing this quote and highlighting boldly on the page.

Later the interviewee goes on to enumerate “the facts he truly believes in”, which very clearly echo official Russian propaganda. A few examples: “Russian warriors do everything they can in order to avoid harming civilians”, “I can’t imagine that our country can be an aggressor”, “there has to be another explanation of what we see in Ukraine today”. These and other claims are rebuked among others by the United Nations and dozens of non-governmental and legal organizations (including the [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=20220228-prosecutor-statement-ukraine)). At the same time, they are common narratives in Russian propaganda (e.g. [this](https://sputniknews.com/20220226/moscow-considers-natos-claims-about-russian-aggression-in-ukraine-groundless-1093401012.html) and [this](https://sputniknews.com/20220224/russian-mod-precision-weapons-used-to-neutralise-military-infrastructure-and-air-forces-of-ukraine-1093321077.html)), and the editors failed to call them out as such. Whether intentional or not, the interviewee denies the war and translates the Russian official narrative that “Russian people wish for peace on Earth”. From the interview one may even get an impression that Ukrainians perhaps “deserve” this since a Russian soldier “would rather sacrifice himself than take an innocent life”. Broadcasting such opinions without any commentary from the editors is at least unprofessional and at worst immoral.

By publishing and thus giving validity and credibility to such opinions without proper contextualization, IEEE Spectrum does not promote discussion but furthers misinformation. Of course, the interviewee is entitled to his opinions. At the same time, we can not entirely rule out a possibility of this being a propaganda piece ordered by the Russian State. Either way, the piece presented as is undeniably plays into the official Russian propaganda.

Moreover, while attempting to cover “A Russian Perspective on the War in Ukraine” the editors of IEEE Spectrum have missed to mention an open letter from 8000 Russian scientists, who have spoken against the war and clearly stated that it is the Russian Federation that invaded Ukraine, "Having unleashed the war, Russia doomed itself to international isolation, to the position of a pariah country." (Original in [Russian](https://t-invariant.org/2022/02/we-are-against-war/?fbclid=IwAR0oPBDG51Fka32CC7a1fP-K3eLJe7_7_4ttJ3iKaJor9d4J5zMh1gwWQTk) and an [English](https://www.eureporter.co/world/russia/2022/02/24/an-open-letter-from-russian-scientists-and-science-journalists-against-the-war-with-ukraine/) version).

To sum up, we believe that IEEE Spectrum should not have published this opinion piece in its present form: with little to no context or discussion as to its credibility, presented “alternative facts” and attempts to play into Russian propaganda. 

We thus request that:
IEEE Spectrum acknowledges that they have unwittingly published a piece furthering misinformation and Russian propaganda.
IEEE Spectrum revises the piece by adding critical missing context throughout the piece such as: there is abundance of credible information about the war; the [United Nations overwhelmingly assessed Russia as an aggressor and requested that it withdraws troops from Ukraine](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152); there are dozens of non-governmental and legal organizations (including the [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=20220228-prosecutor-statement-ukraine)) that have corroborated evidence of war crimes; there is an [open letter](https://www.eureporter.co/world/russia/2022/02/24/an-open-letter-from-russian-scientists-and-science-journalists-against-the-war-with-ukraine/) from 8000 Russian scientists, who speak against Russian aggression, etc.
IEEE Spectrum initiates a broader conversation on misinformation/disinformation and propaganda; if the editors wish to really make a difference, they should immediately announce a special issue on the topic of how to detect and mitigate misinformation and fake media.
